### Intersection of Two Arrays II

<p>Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.</p>

#### Example 1:
    
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
```

#### Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]

#### Note:

 - Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
 - The result can be in any order.
 
#### Follow up:
     
 - What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
 - What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
 - What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
 
```JavaScript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums1
 * @param {number[]} nums2
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var intersect = function(nums1, nums2) {
    var result = [];
    var searched = [];
    for(var i =0; i<nums1.length;++i){
        for(var j= 0; j<nums2.length;++j){
            if(nums1[i] === nums2[j] && searched[j] !=1){
                result.push(nums1[i]);
                searched[j] = 1;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};
```
